# Fantastic Feast Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A meal planning website that let's users add their favourite recipies to a weekly planner. The app is still under development.

# Currently you can ...

- View your recipe planner for one week
- Add new recipe plans
- Remove recipes
- Go to recipe website
- Log out

# Future developments to come

- Calendar based interface (not just one week)
- Possibility to create own comments to recipes (in-app)
- Possibility to create own recipes (ingredients + instructions)
